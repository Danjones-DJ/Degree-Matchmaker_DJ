Year 2 Striking a balance between breadth and depth you can study either two or three subjects in your second year. As in Year 1 you can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject. For example, if you choose BSc Joint Honours degree in: Biology and Chemistry must take six core modules. Biology and Psychology must take six core modules. If you are studying for the BSc in Natural Sciences, your choices are only limited by progression and the academic timetable. You can build on one or two of the subjects studied in your first year, but you can also add a new subject by taking a first-year module in Year 2. Year 3 (Year 4 if undertaking a placement or year abroad) In the final year you can choose either two or three subjects. It is possible to specialise in greater depth by taking up to five modules in one subject. For example, if you choose BSc Joint Honours degree in: Chemistry and Earth Sciences, you must take two core modules in Chemistry and at least two modules from Earth Sciences with the remaining modules from these subjects, which could be none, one or two. Business and Computer Science, you must take at least two modules from each subject with the remaining modules from these subjects. The BSc in Natural Sciences offers continued freedom in your final year. This year includes a capstone module which is a final project designed to consolidate your learning. You will combine modules in subjects already studied to a higher level and the main subjects studied will be listed on the degree certificate. Additional Pathways Students can apply to be transferred onto either the with Year Abroad or with Placement pathway. Places on these pathways are in high demand and if you are chosen your studies will extend from three years to four or four to five depending on course. Create Your Own Prospectus Explore Our Scholarships Meet Our Students Learning Methods of learning will vary according to subject choice but are likely to include lectures and small-group seminars alongside tutorials, workshops and practical classes. Using the latest resources, practical sessions may provide hands-on experience of the type of work performed by professionals in the various disciplines. We place great emphasis on high-quality small-group teaching. The small-group format and guidance from your academic advisor help get more out of your studies. As you progress to the final year there's an increased focus on self-directed learning and independent research as you begin to prepare for professional or postgraduate life. Assessment All subjects are assessed by examinations, but there may be some element of continuous assessment in modules where there is a practical element. Assessment is designed to evaluate your knowledge and understanding of the material, test your critical thinking and determine your ability to relate your learning to real-world issues. In your final year, you will be required to study modules where the content is student driven and involves independent thought and personal management of the work’s direction.

Year 2 Striking a balance between breadth and depth you can study either two or three subjects in your second year. As in Year 1, you can specialise by taking up to four modules in one subject from Group A. For example, if you choose the MSci Joint Honours degree in: Chemistry and Physics, you must take six core modules. Biology and Chemistry, you must take six core modules equally balanced between the two subjects. If you are following the MSci (Honours) in Natural Sciences and specialising in a single science subject in the final year, you have considerable freedom which is only limited by progression and the timetable. Typically, you will: take three or four core modules build on one or two subjects studied in the first year have the option of starting a new subject by taking a first-year module. Year 3 You can choose either two or three subjects. It is possible to specialise in greater depth by taking up to four modules in one subject from Group A. You can also opt to take a second-year module during this year. For example, if you choose the MSci Joint Honours degree in: Chemistry and Physics, you must take the six core modules. Chemistry and Mathematics, you must take five core modules plus one module from the Mathematics list. The MSci in Natural Sciences offers continued freedom in Year 3. You will combine modules in subjects already studied to a higher level. Year 4 The final year includes a research project designed to consolidate your learning. In addition, you will take a selection of taught modules. Module availability can change, but those available to current MSci Joint Honours students are: Biology and Chemistry: Bioactive Chemistry 4; Biomolecular Analysis. Biology and Physics: Atomic and Optical Physics; Biological Imaging; Theoretical Physics 4. Chemistry and Mathematics: Chemical Physics 4; Computational Chemical Physics 4; Modules from the Level 4 Mathematics list. Chemistry and Physics: Chemical Physics 4; Computational Chemical Physics 4; Atomic and Optical Physics; Theoretical Physics 4. The MSci (Honours) in Natural Sciences continues to offer freedom of choice in the final year. You will combine modules in subjects already studied to a higher level and the main subjects studied will be listed on the degree certificate. The final year typically involves: combining advanced modules in subjects already studied specialising in or combining: Chemistry; Computer Science; Earth Sciences; Mathematics; Physics (please note that Biology can only be studied in Year 4 as part of a Joint Honours degree).
