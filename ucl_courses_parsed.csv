Unlike a conventional degree in architecture where students generally follow the same curriculum, this degree will allow students to customise their own course through a wide choice of optional modules taken in other disciplines at UCL. In addition to modules at The Bartlett, you may select from topics in other departments including anthropology, archaeology, art history, economics, planning, education, geography, management, and politics. Consistently at the forefront of architectural debate, The Bartlett School of Architecture is renowned for its innovative and experimental research in architecture which includes design, history and theory, and technology. This course offers an interdisciplinary education with a specialisation in architecture. Operating without the constraints of the professional RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects) requirements, its emphasis is on developing your own creative practice by exploring speculative and practice-based methods alongside more conventional approaches to design and making. In the studio, students are encouraged to interrogate alternative modalities of architecture and design, drawing from wide-ranging methodologies that include artistic practice, furniture design, fiction, filmmaking, fashion, and performance as well as more traditional media of architectural drawings and models. Some of our graduates have pursued the MArch route after their undergraduate degree. Over the three years of the degree, students will have the opportunity to strategically develop expertise and skills in particular areas, across disciplines. For example, students can take modules relating to sustainability, the environment and climate change on our programme and shared with other programmes at The Bartlett, but also across other departments at UCL. This develops a deep and varied knowledge base of key issues to our society and innovative forms of knowledge profoundly relevant to the built environment today. Examples of other timely topics and practices which our students explore through a range of disciplines across UCL include spatial justice, filmmaking, urbanism and cities, and AI and machine learning. At the same time, students can acquire additional complementary skills which support their goals for after university, through modules for example in marketing, creative writing, programming or a language. Students will develop the necessary intellectual and practical skills to engage with architecture and the city of London in an increasingly globalised age. Students participate in The Bartlett's annual Summer Show, a major exhibition at the end of the academic year that attracts over 12,000 visitors. The course also offers students the option to study abroad for one year, subject to availability, exploring architecture within a global context and opening further avenues of specialisation for the future, adding an additional year to the duration of the course. We are consistently placed at the top of the QS World University Subject Rankings. In 2025, The Bartlett faculty ranked #1 in the world for Architecture and the Built Environment , and we remained #1 in the UK for the 11th year running.

From your first year, you will begin to use equipment and facilities used by audiologists in clinical settings to develop your own clinical skills. As well as developing your clinical skills, the course will allow you to gain experience delivering audiology services in real clinical settings on your integrated placements at NHS teaching hospitals, hearing aid dispensers and private sector clinics. On your placements, you will shadow and work with a registered audiologist to gain first-hand experience in completing clinical assessments and hearing aid fittings. By your third year, you will have developed enough confidence and gained enough experience to complete audiological assessment and rehabilitation while being supervised on your placements. You will meet members of the public with audiological disorders who will share their experiences and work with you to enhance your understanding of ear-related conditions. Working as an audiologist is a very rewarding career and often appeals to people who enjoy both problem-solving and helping others. Audiologists often make significant improvements to patients’ lives, as hearing loss and ear disorders can be isolating and detrimental to people’s quality of life. Furthermore, our small cohort sizes (fewer than 45 students) provide a sense of community and allow informal and interactive teaching where you can easily ask questions. Your teaching will be based at the Ear Institute, which has a strong sense of community with academic and social events planned throughout the year. You will be joining a faculty of researchers, academics and students who are all passionate about advancing the understanding of hearing loss and related disorders and improving outcomes for patients. Students are also encouraged to engage with the whole of the UCL student community with opportunities to join sports clubs and societies or attend a wide variety of campus events (from volunteering fairs to movie screenings).

Merging the two essential fields of business and healthcare, our Business and Health BSc is a dynamic and innovative programme that enables you to become a business-savvy leader in this ever-growing sector. You’ll learn key principles and practices in business management, which examine accounting, marketing, finance, strategy and entrepreneurship to enable you to become familiar with the core issues concerning planning, organising, leading and controlling activity in the context of health and healthcare. The programme is designed to enable students to specialise and tailor their experience to their specific needs through a diverse range of modules and specialist routes: Health Science and Healthcare Management. On the Health Science route, you explore the biological, behavioural, and social aspects of health and disease, providing a broader understanding of health and disease and preparing students for diverse careers in healthcare, research, education, and public health. On the Healthcare Management route, you focus on the administration, organisation, and leadership of healthcare organisations and systems. You examine the operational and strategic aspects of healthcare delivery, including managing resources, implementing policies, and ensuring efficient and effective healthcare services. You also have the option to study the three-year BSc or a four-year integrated Master’s, the Business and Health MSci. The MSci includes a one-year placement where students will either study abroad or undertake a work placement, subject to availability. Whether you decide to do the Bachelor’s or integrated Master’s degree, you will leave this programme equipped to be a business and health leader in one of the most dynamic and growing sectors in the world. UCL is a world-leading university, ranked among the top ten in the QS World University Rankings 2025 and is winner of The Times and Sunday Times University of the Year 2024. The university is also a global leader in public health - ranked 3rd in the world for public health (ShanghaiRankings 2024). This programme is delivered by UCL’s Global Business School for Health (UCL GBSH), the world’s first business school dedicated to health and healthcare management. We are based at UCL East - right in the heart of the Olympic Park in east London. We are immersed in our communities of east London and in the MedCity knowledge zone of Bloomsbury which is home to UCL’s central campus and research community. The UCL Global Business School for Health facilitates interactions with employers through numerous Careers Fairs, our in-house careers team, networking opportunities, speaker sessions and our ever-growing UCL GBSH alumni networks.

Merging the two essential fields of business and healthcare, our Business and Health MSci is a dynamic and innovative programme that enables you to become a business-savvy leader in this ever-growing sector. You’ll learn key principles and practices in business management, which examine accounting, marketing, finance, strategy and entrepreneurship to enable you to become familiar with the core issues concerning planning, organising, leading and controlling activity in the context of health and healthcare. The programme is designed to enable students to specialise and tailor their experience to their specific needs through a diverse range of modules and specialist routes: Health Science and Healthcare Management. On the Health Science route, you explore the biological, behavioural, and social aspects of health and disease, providing a broader understanding of health and disease and preparing students for diverse careers in healthcare, research, education, and public health. On the Healthcare Management route, you focus on the administration, organisation, and leadership of healthcare organisations and systems. You examine the operational and strategic aspects of healthcare delivery, including managing resources, implementing policies, and ensuring efficient and effective healthcare services. In Year 3, MSci students either attend their study abroad programme or their work placement. These two options are open to all MSci students regardless of your chosen route (Health Science or Healthcare Management), subject to availability. The work placement and the study abroad option will take place over the whole academic year. Whether you decide to do the Business and Health BSc or MSci, you will leave this programme equipped to be a business and health leader in one of the most dynamic and growing sectors in the world. UCL is a world-leading university, ranked among the top ten in the QS World University Rankings 2025 and is winner of The Times and Sunday Times University of the Year 2024. The university is also a global leader in public health - ranked 3rd in the world for public health (ShanghaiRankings 2024). This programme is delivered by UCL’s Global Business School for Health (UCL GBSH), the world’s first business school dedicated to health and healthcare management. We are based at UCL East - right in the heart of the Olympic Park in east London. We are immersed in our communities of east London and in the MedCity knowledge zone of Bloomsbury which is home to UCL’s central campus and research community. The UCL Global Business School for Health facilitates interactions with employers through the programme’s placement options and numerous Careers Fairs, our in-house careers team, networking opportunities, speaker sessions and our ever-growing UCL GBSH alumni network.

In each year, you will receive regular programme-related classes in geography and economics. Teaching and research in both departments engages with society's most pressing problems. Learning how to understand and respond to these challenges requires drawing on the strengths of focused social scientific analysis and the breadth of knowledge of a combined honours degree. You will acquire a distinctive mix of theoretical and practical skills (including a range of analytical techniques, independent research skills, and project work) and specialised knowledge of the core principles of Economics, key approaches in Geography, and ways of integrating the two. This training, and a degree that combines a core set of study with a very wide choice of optional areas of specialisation, makes UCL Geography and Economics students very attractive to employers in the UK and around the world, in finance, policy and government, and other sectors.

The Global Humanitarian Studies BSc explores how humanitarian systems, governments and people respond to these challenges, combining academic theory with real-world application. It prepares students for diverse careers in the humanitarian sector and beyond. You will study crises caused by natural hazards, climate change, forced displacement and systemic inequalities, with the opportunity to examine the intersection of humanitarianism and policy, technology, law, culture, health and economics. You will learn a range of skills, bringing together approaches from different disciplines, to better understand humanitarian crises from a range of perspectives and build a multi-disciplinary approach to reducing and managing crises. The Global Humanitarian Studies BSc is delivered by the Department of Risk and Disaster Reduction (UCL RDR). Our staff come from diverse backgrounds, and teaching is delivered by academics with extensive field experience, ensuring that learning is informed by real-world insight. The programme also includes guest lectures from industry, academia and the policy arena. We conduct research across six key areas: climate change and adaptation; conflict and migration; health and social risks; inclusion and politics, and warning, resilience and finance – so students are exposed to a broad range of topics across these core areas throughout their studies.

This degree offers a distinct advantage over sport science or physiotherapy programmes for those seeking comprehensive knowledge in human health, clinical exercise applications, and the psychology and neuroscience behind exercise. This programme offers you the following benefits and opportunities: Great preparation for careers across healthcare, industry, academia, and elite sport. You’ll have a strong foundation in medical sciences covering exercise medicine, sports injuries, human health and performance, and disease. A distinct set of skills. The clinical medical specialism of this course sets it apart from traditional sports science degrees. Your skills will include evidence-based exercise prescription, clinical and biomechanical assessment of common sports injuries and their management, and fundamental applied research skills and medical statistics. Optional topics, such as public engagement, policy and bioscience funding, mean the course is also ideal for anyone who is interested in public health, strategy and government policy and wants to work in non-clinical fields. You will be prepared to tackle the urgent questions surrounding the burden of chronic disease on society. Flexibility. You can transfer to one of the faculty's 'sister courses' in your first year if you feel that one of these is a better fit for you (and there is capacity). This way, you can shape your degree to fit your career aspirations. Strong reputation. UCL is ranked 6th in the world for Medicine (QS World University Rankings, 2024). The Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health’s international network in elite performance and public health provides prestigious career opportunities for motivated students. You'll develop a thorough grounding in human body systems, health and disease, anatomy, and physiology. The course bridges the gap between traditional biomedical science and innovations in exercise medicine. You'll access a vibrant research community of leading scientists, clinicians, and academics at UCL. You'll also work with students of related programmes and participate in projects across the university. You'll collaborate on research undertaken by the Institute of Sport Exercise and Health and its partners, including the English Institute of Sport, the International Olympic Committee and University College London Hospitals.","Foundations in Human Physiology and Cellular Biology | Cardiovascular and Respiratory Function in Health and Disease | The Gut, Liver and Drug Metabolism | Cardiorespiratory Exercise Physiology | Kidneys, Hormones and Fluid Balance | Functional Anatomy & Medical Imaging in Sport & Exercise Medicine | Data Interpretation and Evaluation of Science | Musculoskeletal Systems in Health and Disease",https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/foundations-in-human-physiology-and-cellular-biology-MEDC0001 | https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/cardiovascular-and-respiratory-function-in-health-and-disease-MEDC0002 | https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/the-gut-liver-and-drug-metabolism-MEDC0003 | https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/cardiorespiratory-exercise-physiology-SURG0111 | https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/kidneys-hormones-and-fluid-balance-MEDC0004 | https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/functional-anatomy--medical-imaging-in-sport--exercise-medicine-SURG0169 | https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/data-interpretation-and-evaluation-of-science-MEDC0006 | https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/musculoskeletal-systems-in-health-and-disease-MEDC0009,Health Economics | Introduction to Clinical Trials | Nutrition and Metabolism 2 | Health and Behaviour,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/health-economics-IEHC0002 | https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/introduction-to-clinical-trials-MEDC0014 | https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/nutrition-and-metabolism-2-MEDC0090 | https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/health-and-behaviour-IEHC0056,https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships
